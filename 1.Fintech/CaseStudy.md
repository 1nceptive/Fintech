# IBM Streamline Financial Netting Disrupting the Fintech Industry 
``Shehryar Riaz ``

### Charles Ranlett Flint founded IBM, also known as International Business Machines Corporation, in 1911 as the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company. IBM began by manufacturing punch-card tabulating systems. IBM did not invest extensively in technology until after World War II due to its development. IBM went on to become one of the main computer manufacturers in the United States. Since 2000, IBM has continuously placed one of their supercomputers near the top of the industry's list of most powerful machines as determined by standardised computation tests. In addition to creating supercomputers for governments and major enterprises, IBM's supercomputer group built the Cell Broadband Engine in collaboration with the Toshiba Corporation and the Sony Corporation of Japan. This powerful computer chip, which was developed over a four-year period beginning in 2001, has a wide range of uses, including supercomputers, Toshiba high-definition televisions, and the Sony Playstation 3 electronic gaming system. IBM also created computer chips for the Microsoft Corporation Xbox 360 and Nintendo Corporation Wii game consoles. IBM is a for-profit corporation that is primarily reliant on its large clientele.





## IBM Business Activities

###  By introducing efficient netting via the blockchain, IBM hopes to bring innovation and speed to established financial institutions. The netting system between two or more parties works as follows: participants submit transaction data to the blockchain in real time from their in-house apps, allowing visibility to selected participants but not to everyone else and protecting anonymity in a multi-party setting. This solution eliminates mistakes caused by manual data input operations and makes transactions accessible for netting more quickly — real processing is based on the time agreement between participating parties.

### Blockchain smart contracts encode and automate these agreements, as well as other business rules controlling transactions and relationships between parties, as well as regulatory governance standards. Smart contracts can also incorporate the mathematical instructions for the netting itself, determining who owes what to whom in a variety of methods.

> - **Operational simplification:** ***Blockchain enables real-time, multi-party tracking and management of bank guarantees and letters of credit.***

> - **Automated compliance:** ***Depend on faster and more accurate reporting with an automated compliance process that draws on immutable data records.***

> - **Faster settlement:** ***Benefit from the near real-time, point-to-point transfer of funds between financial institutions, removing friction and accelerating settlement.***

> - **Increase security through encryption and tamper-evident distributed ledger technology**
> - **Provide transparency and enhance trust with permissioned access to transaction data**




### IBM's blockchain services are aimed at banks, foreign exchanges, and enterprises who need to nett their transactions. IBM has an edge owing to its dominance in and outside of the technology sector, good reputation, and rising cloud computing powers that its competitors do not have.

### IBM makes use of the hybrid cloud market, which allows businesses to connect public cloud providers with private cloud infrastructure. This, along with its blockchain services, yields significant advantages such as control, speed, security, and cheap cost.

##  Landscape

### IBM is a member of the financial industry's Regtech realm. When compared to traditional payment methods, the combination of cloud computing technology and Blockchain enables for quicker, more secure, and transparent payments via the usage of cryptocurrencies or digital assets. This is why blockchain has significantly impacted the Fintech sector in recent years and continues to gain traction. Azure Blockchain Workbench, Ethereum, Hyperledger, and Amazon managed blockchain are some of the other key players in this space.

##  Results 

### Because IBM's blockchain services rely on the distributed ledger technology, its primary efforts are directed on Hyperleder, the Linux Foundation's open source programme for developing blockchain expressly for business customers. According to the most recent Hyperledger annual report, issued in early December, 67 firms and organisations are already developing projects on the blockchain platform. IBM has become the program's top donor, with 3,631 commits, more than double the number of the second-highest contributor.


### While Hyperledger may be regarded as a basis, IBM determined that just developing the tools would not enough. To overcome sceptics, it would need to develop methods to illustrate what blockchain might achieve. To that aim, the second component of its approach has been to bring together blockchain initiatives that can be utilised across sectors. The IBM Food Trust Network is perhaps the initiative that has garnered the most attention. It was created to assist in the creation of openness across the food supply chain. "From the farm to the customer, including all the parties in between, such as processors, merchants, and transportation." IBM has now expanded its IBM Food Trust Network to include big corporations such as Walmart and Carrefour.

### The fundamental criteria used to gauge success in this sector are how much of the larger markets have adapted to a project. In such a situation, IBM has worked on various projects and is therefore functioning well. IBM is now surpassing its competition because of its money and resources, which can be adapted to each of its high profile customers.

## Recommendations
### IBM currently offers a large range of products and services, but one product I would recommend is the linking of salary and taxes. IBM would have a large clientele, such as governments, who would benefit greatly from this, given there is a lot of tax evasion these days. Access to confidential personal pay rolls, which will be securely maintained on the blockchain, would be enabled by the technology. Furthermore, users' bank accounts can be linked to see their expenditure, and estimated or final tax filing paperwork can be prepared automatically. Blockchain is appropriate for this situation since no transactions can be faked, they will be transparent, and each individual's spending/salary will be tracked in a trust worthy manner.
